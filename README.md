With the onset of this pandemic, the world is gradually shifting towards an online ecosystem of work and study. There has been a sudden spurt in the number of online learning platforms and resources and at the same time, peer to peer interaction has seen a drastic downfall.

The learning resources for skill development, are available online and that too at NO or MINIMUM COSTS. Students and learners have benefited a lot, and are able to boost their careers. 

But, at the same time, a large proportion of them have found it difficult to adapt to this change. In short, they are getting trapped in the TUTORIAL HELL.
With a lot to choose from, students often get confused between the learning paths. They approach various sites to solve their learning problems, like stack overflow. But the issue still persists.

This problem inspired us, to build an application, where learners can get access to a wide community of students and professionals who have faced the similar challenges and can offer useful guidance with their valuable experiences, so that one can stride their career paths in the best way possible, without falling prey to the tutorial hell.
That is, this app aims to provide mentorship and peer interaction all at one place.
